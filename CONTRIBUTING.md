It's just the 4 of us now. We should just follow the milestone/tasks and basic branching protocol and we should be good. Obviously for the first bare bones implementation y'all can push to main. 

Also name the branches and commits in a declarative fashion, if this ever makes it out of stanford we want our shitty code to be useable for the hired engineers. 

But once we have some basic shit working like a very bare bones MVP that is robustly tested and deployed, y'all should start branching for each feature and running tests. 

This is looking to be a lot of work to do correctly, but after doing some basic market research it actually seems like a really fun idea. Margins look really good in this business. 

GoodRX is a fucking search engine for pharma end users and brings in several billion. And it does not even process insurance. 

It acts like insurance by negotiating with PBMs but they don't have direct distribution with doctors like we would, which is kind of a genius play from Dr. David Svec.  

Let's knock this out of the park!
